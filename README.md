# Quantitative Economics Workshop

The first *Quantitative Economics Workshop* in Paris will take place on __September 12,13,14__ at the CREST.

Confirmed speakers include [Edouard Challe](https://sites.google.com/site/edouardchalle/) (EUI), [Beatrice Cherrier](https://beatricecherrier.wordpress.com/about/) (CREST), [Alfred Galichon](http://alfredgalichon.com/) (NYU Paris, [Math+Econ+Code](https://www.math-econ-code.org/)), [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) (ANU/[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/)), [Pablo Winant](https://www.mosphere.fr) (ESCP/CREST/[T2M](https://www.t2m.network/))


The goal of the workshop is to stimulate community exchanges around the use of opensource tools for structural economics, especially at the new intersection of micro and macro models.

Participants will be acquainted with theory and practice of modern dynamic programming, the building blocks of heterogenous agents, as well as some elements of optimal transport problems in economics.

Mornings will be devoted to computational lectures that will systematically rely on interactive notebooks that students can run and modify. Examples will be shown in Python and/or Julia depending on the applications. A general familiarity with programming concepts is advised but Python or Julia. 


PhD students as well as interested researchers are welcome. Attendance is free, space permitting. If you wish to register or need any additional information please write to organizers@t2m.network. There is also a devoted budget to partially cover accomodation expenses for PhD students traveling to Paris, please contact us if you wish to to apply for it.
